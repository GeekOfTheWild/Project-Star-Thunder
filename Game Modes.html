The objective for the attacking team is to destroy the enemy base. The attacking faction wins if they do this in under an hour and before all the attacking teams capital ships and flagship are destroyed. Otherwise the defenders win. If you are the attacking team you can spawn as a starship or gunship from capital ships and your flagship or any type of vehicle from various outpost etc. around the map, but all of these start on the defenders team and you must claim them for you're team to use them. As the defending team you can spawn from your base or from the aforementioned outposts as long as they are still on your side.</p>
